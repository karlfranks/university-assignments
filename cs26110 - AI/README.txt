Note: The runnable jar does not work on my system, however I have heard from multiple other people they have also had problems with their executable JAR (and people online with problems with exporting JAR files fro Eclipse).

The code will therefore need to be imported into Eclipse (unless the JAR works on your machine) to be able to run.
