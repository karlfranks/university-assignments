# The Artificial Intelligence Toolbox Part 1: How To Find Solutions

For this assignment the main task for me was to implement Best First Search, and add different heuristics. The majority of the code was provided and I had to essentially finish it off.

The code runs a program displaying a maze, with options to customise the maze (eg size, complexity of maze) and allows the users to select from a variety of algorithms of solving the maze.

Note: The runnable jar does not work on my system, however I have heard from multiple other people they have also had problems with their executable JAR (and people online with problems with exporting JAR files fro Eclipse).
The code will therefore need to be imported into Eclipse (unless the JAR works on your machine) to be able to run.
