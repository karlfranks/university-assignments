			<strong>Profile</strong>
			<br />
			Hard working Computer Science student currently in their first year at Aberystwyth University,
			on track for a first-class honours degree with a keen attention to detail and experience using
			web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, now seeking industrial year experience in the web sector.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Skills</strong>
			<br />
				<ul>
					<li>I have an astute attention to detail, once I get started on a project I immediately
					find myself pouring over every fine detail in an attempt to fulfill the requirements as
					fully as possible</li>
					<li>Through my degree scheme I have knowledge of standard web languages such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and PHP</li>
					<li>I also have an appreciation of other web technologies such as JSON and Python</li>
					<li>I believe I demonstrate good team membership qualities, during a university trip for first year
					Computer Science students I regularly made sure everyone in my team’s ideas were heard and considered instead of
					allowing one loud voice to dominate.</li>
					<li>I have a passion to always try and learn more, during the summer I intend to further my knowledge of
					web development by coding my own website using languages I have not previously used before such as Python
					in an attempt to learn these languages and broaden my horizons.</li>
				</ul>

					other relatively simple tasks such as offering technical support to other employees and creating a map of ethernet
					ports currently in use in the office.</li>
					<li>I learned a lot about being part of a team in the workplace and boosted my confidence in interacting with other employees/customers.</li>
				</ul></li>

		<strong>Interests</strong>
		<br />
			I have a large interest in technology so try to stay up to date with developments in this field especially
			the web through reading websites such as The Verge and the technology columns in newspapers.<br />
			As aforementioned I was part of the Scouting movement for many years, and as a Scout I was a “Sixer”
			in charge of a group of five other younger scouts.<br />
			I am a keen reader enjoying books such as the “A Song of Ice and Fire” series by George RR Martin, and a frequent moviegoer.
